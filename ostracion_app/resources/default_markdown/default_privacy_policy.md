Legal information for [[APPLICATION_NAME]]

### Main Statement

This Website has no interest in collecting any kind of visitor
personally-identifiable information, other than
what is strictly necessary to function properly.
No tracking of users, or their activity, is in
place, neither internally nor by means of third-party services.

## More detail

### Account user data

Users who visit the site as logged-in users, as opposed to anonymously,
choose (or are given) a fixed username, that uniquely identifies them,
and are free to provide additional data such as their full name
and their email address. This is not compulsory, it is perfectly
fine to enter a fake full name and a non-existing or blank email address:
in fact, the email address will *never* be used in any automated way.

In case a user decides to provide real data, though, this Website
will not communicate said information to any other service. The only
other users able to see the email address are the Website administrators.

### Cookies

When users who have an account on [[APPLICATION_NAME]] log in, their
browser receives a few "technical" cookies, text snippets used in
subsequent communications between the browser and the server to keep
the information on the user being rightfully logged in. These cookies are
of a volatile nature and do not convey any kind of personally-identifiable
information.

Users can control and/or delete the cookies as desired - as detailed e.g. at
[https://allaboutcookies.org](https://allaboutcookies.org/)
- and selectively decide which
websites are allowed to operate with cookies on the browser.

Users who decide to remove/disable cookies on [[APPLICATION_NAME]] may be unable
to log in or experience a faulty navigation of the Website.

### Sessions and security

In order to provide some protection against brute-force automated password
guessing by malicious parties, hence to protect the integrity of user accounts
on the Website, for each login attempt reaching the Website,
an _anonymized_ form of the IP address of the host from which the attempt
originates is kept to enforce the protection.

### System Logs

As is customary for any Web server, some access information is recorded in
log files, namely:

- IP address from which the request originates;
- the request field "User-Agent";
- the exact request URL;
- date and time of the request.

These data are kept for no more than 12 weeks and can be
inspected by the Administrators of the hosting server if need be (e.g. for
investigations in case the server fall under attack, which in fact is the
sole purpose for storing such data).
