# Terms and Conditions

The following Terms govern the use of this website; all provisions, unless
explicitly stated otherwise, apply to both anonymous and logged-in users
(including those with the `admin` role).
Acceptance of these conditions is required in order to have any interaction
with the website.

These Terms are really reasonable and boil down to a few simple rules:

- do not expect any guarantee from this website, use it as it is;
- if you are the victim of unfairness through the website, let us know;
- administrators' powers are not regulated (but admins will be nice);
- do not try to bend the website to your shady/illegal purposes.

Keep reading for the fine-print details.

## Overview

These Terms establish the rules governing the interaction between users
(i.e. anybody who visits the website in any way)
and the website itself (i.e. this instance of Ostracion, running
on a specific server, named [[APPLICATION_NAME]]).
The "About" page provides more information on the latter, in particular
a way to contact the responsible for the website.

The actors playing a role in these Terms are:

- the site maintainer, system administrator of the server that runs the website;
- the administrators, users of the website with the `admin` role;
- and all users, anonymous or logged-in, who interact with the website.

## Limitations

The website is offered **"as is"**: that means:

- that no user has the right to expect compensation for any
  faulty functioning of the website, including downtime;
- that there is no obligation to communicate anything, by the
  administrators or the site maintainer, to other users;
- that the website may change in its appearance or functioning, or
  even be withdrawn, with no obligation of prior notice;
- that administrators and site maintainer are under no obligation
  to provide assistance with troubles using the website.

## Rights of the users

These Terms hold in conjunction with the website Privacy policy, which can
be read at the appropriate URL, and spells out explicitly the privacy-related
rights of users of the website.

Moreover, users have the right to access (view, download, use subsequently)
all contents available to them through the website, provided no other issues
hold (such as certain usages of said contents being protected by copyright
issues). It is responsibility of the downloader, and not of the uploader,
to ensure they have the rights to the intended usage of the contents.

Administrators have the right to change the permissions that rule access to any
content, and they may do so without informing the users.
If a user knows that any usage of contents constitutes a violation of their
rights (or third-party rights), they can reach out to the contact address
found in the "About" page to let the site maintainer know.

Further, administrators have the power to access all contents hosted on
the website.

### Cancellations

In certain conditions, both administrators and other users have the power
to delete or change contents hosted in the website which have been uploaded
by another user. In particular:

- in boxes with the right access permissions, regular users
  can delete contents by anybody;
- in boxes with the right access permissions, regular users
  can upload new contents, overwriting same-named contents previously hosted;
- in boxes with the right access permissions, regular users
  can alter metadata associated to contents (titles, descriptions, icons);
- in _all boxes_, administrators have full change/delete/overwrite permissions.

In all the cases above, there is no compensation or legitimate reason
to complain for lost/changed contents.
Moreover, administrator can change the profile of all users (icon,
name and contact data, password), configure their permissions, as well as:

- temporarily **ban the user** from accessing the website;
- permanently **delete the user** (together with all their contributions
  to the website).

Although a sensible administrator does so only if circumstances really require
such drastic action, it is understood that administrators are under no
obligation to motivate those actions as part of the interaction of the users
with the website.

## Prohibited usages

The website shall under no circumstances be used to host, or promote traffic of,
**illegal material** (which means: illegal in the country where the server
reside, namely the European Union). This includes, but is not limited to:

- child pornography;
- copyright-violating digital material (books, movies, music and the like);
- illegally-obtained data (credit card numbers, classified information).

Access credentials (the combination of username and password allowing a
user to enter the website as a logged-in user) are strictly personal
and cannot be given to others, traded or bartered.

Users must not attempt to interrupt or damage the functioning of the website
in any way (such as with a cyberattack); they must not attempt to impersonate
the website (with techniques such as DNS spoofing); they must not attempt
to impersonate other users (e.g. by stealing or cracking their password).

## Validity of the Terms

These Terms may be changed, amended or updated at any time, by the
administrators, with no obligation of notice to all users.
